# Traffic-Sign-Classifier-with-GUI
It is a multi-class supervised learning problem, with more than 40 classes and 50k images in total.
The data is taken from ‘German traffic Sign Benchmark’ on Kaggle. 
The model was built using KERAS library (python), and a GUI was built using TKINTER that allowed the users to upload images of traffic sign, and to predict and display its class.

1. traffic_sign_imgclass_grayscale(final) : contains the Source-code of the image classifier
2. Image Dataset : The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint  Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011.
    Single-image, multi-class classification problem
    More than 40 classes
    More than 50,000 images in total
    Large, lifelike database.
