# Traffic-Sign-Classifier-with-GUI
It is a multi-class supervised learning problem, with more than 40 classes and 15k images in total.
The data is taken from ‘German traffic Sign Benchmark’ on Kaggle. 
The model was built using KERAS library (python), and a GUI was built using TKINTER that allowed the users to upload images of traffic sign, and to predict and display its class.
